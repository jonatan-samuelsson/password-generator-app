## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This is the project were I felt a lot of JS stuff came together for me, particularly with regards to QuerySelector, naming and clean DRY code / compartmentalized logic. 

I'm also happy about my desicion to omit the generate-button, as the dynamic generation made it obsolete. 

Finally, I liked my idea of adjusting the max length of the password accoring to screen size to avoid overflow while still utilizing the increased space available at bigger sizes.

### Continued development

Going forward, I would like to make even cleaner JS logic. Also, as the codebases grow, practicing annotating with comments to clarify for others becomes increasingly important.

### Useful resources

- [MindpointGroup on password strength](https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/password-strength-and-complexity) - Here I found the entropy equation for calculating password strength
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I used lots of MDN articles to get stuff right.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used lots of W3 articles as well, particularly for styling range slider and copying to clipboard w/ JS.
